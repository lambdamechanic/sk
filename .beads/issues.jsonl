The command should clone (or update) the repo into the sk cache so that `sk list-repo \u003crepo\u003e` (or similar) can enumerate available skills before installing. It should hook into the existing config/default host parsing so users can run e.g. `sk repo add @anthropics/skills` or pass full git URLs, and it should reuse the same caching logic used by `sk install`. Update the README/quickstart to explain how to add a repo, inspect its catalog, and then install specific skills. Add tests that drive the new command to ensure the repo is cached and that subsequent `sk install` can target it without fetching again.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-14T13:02:56.738267763+07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-15T07:48:30.976750856+07:00","closed_at":"2025-11-14T13:18:24.921251299+07:00"}
