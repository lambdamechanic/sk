It should hook into the existing config/default host parsing so users can run e.g. `sk repo add @anthropics/skills` or pass full git URLs, and it should reuse the same caching logic used by `sk install`. Update the README/quickstart to explain how to add a repo, inspect its catalog, and then install specific skills.
